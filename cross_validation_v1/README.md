# Cross validation protocal for Pocket2Drug model
The docking scores are used to evaluate the performance of the model. The procedures are listed below:

1. Generate pdbqt files for the molecules generated by the model with highest frequency, and compute their docking boxes using ```rank_prepare_pdbqt.py```.   

2. Sample random molecules from Zinc with the same molecular distribution of the model output moclecules for each pocket using ```zinc_sampler.py```.   

3. Generate pdbqt files for the random Zinc molecules using ```rank_prepare_pdbqt.py```.   

4. Run docking to get the docking scores.
